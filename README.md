Hi, my name is Ignacio Pomar.

In my repositories I archieve the project I'd wish to make at worktime, but neve have time for them

# Profesional profile
Throughout my professional life I have gone from a purely technical level to more complex projects, assuming greater responsibility in team management and in company management.

Currently I combine the positions of Managing Director and Chief Information Officer at Grantia Capital as responsible for the quantitative team that develops, implements, and optimizes statistical models. We are specialists in quantitative management: due to our algorithmic investment process, based on mathematical and statistical models, we pursue stable annual returns in any market environment.

My greatest achievements, outside of the professional field, are the publication of a book of short tales with some friends ("La distancia m√°s corta" with the editorial vivelibro in 2016), visited several countries, climbed to the base camp of the K2 in the karakorum mountain range (5135 meters of altitude), and above all, being a father.
